# Chair-Shop-Project
I've been studying HTML and CSS, along with other Javascript course, but in this project, I studied and put into practice new skills of CSS in this chair shop project like how to implement different types of typography, how to implement icons, images or illustrations and web design rules such as the different styles that a website can have and as mentioned while studying Jonas's course in Udemy.
